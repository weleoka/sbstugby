A web-based interface for managing the booking system of a holliday business.

Made with MySQL in mind and using PHP PDO.



### Notes and code issues
Working after the ORM principles, but limited, and mainly for easy language portability. Failing... the DB should instead have standard language for relations, probalby english. Language compatability should be restricted to UI strings, nowhere in code and naming.
